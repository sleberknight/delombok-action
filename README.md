# delombok-action
This is a custom delombok action for use with CodeQL workflows.

Inspired by the following:
* https://github.com/advanced-security/delombok
* https://github.com/advanced-security/delombok-action

In contrast to those delombok actions, this one does _not_ attempt to reformat or change the delomboked source files _in any way_. It just runs delombok. Since delomboked code tends to be significantly different than the original source code with Lombok annotations anyway, trying to make them look anything like the original doesn't seem to be worth it.

When CodeQL flags an issue in a delomboked source file, at present the line numbers never match up anyway, and you have to determine whether the issue is in the code generated by Lombok, or your own code. One example is that CodeQL flags source code that uses Lombok's `@With` annotation with a _[TBD-find the violation]_  violation. To figure this out, you need to look at the delomboked code.

This action also ensures (only for Maven projects right now) that the classpath is set so that delombok can correctly process files that use `@Delegate`. Without the classpath, delombok will not be able to process files containing `@Delegate` because it won't know anything about the target class and thus won't know what methods to implement.
